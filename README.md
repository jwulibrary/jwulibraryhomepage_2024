# JWU Providence Library Homepage Redesign (2024)

_Updated 7/29/24, 5 PM_

## Known Issues and Functionality in Progress

### Search and Filters
- Some "Everything" filters not working (e.g., ebooks).
- EBSCO search filters do not work.
- Issue with FAQ filter in search.
- Double search box in the databases search tab.

### Interface Elements
- Chat button is not functional.
- Hours display is currently placeholders.
- "Ask a student" button is not available.
- Announcements section needs finalization (real links, either random shuffle load or carousel slider).

### Mobile and Responsiveness
- Uneven displays in mobile view.

## Design Challenges to Address

### Visual Design
- Improve color contrast (especially with the search box).
- Fine-tune visual weights (boxes, font, etc.) for clarity and prioritization.
- Adjust shadows and irregular sizes.
- Add whitespace for better readability.

### Layout and Functionality
- Content of small tiles (the row of six buttons under the search box and study room links) needs customization based on strategic priorities.
- Reduce extra wasted space in the header (possibly by making hours horizontal).
- Ensure sizes are mathematically related.
- Elegantly tighten the search box (reduce filter size, modify box text, add a "search" label).

### Accessibility
- Ensure accessibility and color contrast compliance.
- Add alt text and aria

## Known Issues and/or Functionality to implement (in progress)

- EBSCO search filters do not work
- Issue with FAQ filter in search
- uneven displays in mobile, etc.
- Double searchbox in the databases search tab

## Design Challenges to address
- colors, etc.
- could use more contrast (especially with the searchbox)
- Fine-tune visual weights for prioritization.
- Adjust shadows and irregular sizes.
- Reduce extra wasted space in the header by making hours horizontal.
- Ensure accessibility and color contrast compliance.
- Define call to action buttons.
- Add whitespace for better readability.
- ensure sizes are mathematically related.
- Elegantly tighten the searchbox (reduce filter size, modify box text, add a "search" label).
